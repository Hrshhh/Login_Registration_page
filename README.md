Built the front-end using REACT and REDUX and styled it using BOOTSTRAP.

Created REST API using EXPRESSJS and MONGODB for the back-end, to handle the routes and database interactions.

Implementing security measures such as encrypting user passwords using BCRYPT and generating JSON WEB TOKENS (JWT) for authentication and authorization. Setting up server-side validation and handling errors, showing problems on UI with the help of TOASTIFY package.

This process requires a strong understanding of each technology and their integration, as well as knowledge of RESTful API design and best practices such as password encryption and token-based authentication.
Additionally, the client and server side should be separated, and the front-end should interact with the back-end via the API routes.
